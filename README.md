This is Ongezellig archive made by Archetypum which conatins all official Studio Massa artwork from petjeaf, all official comics and bonus content from Massadonie (Studio Massa's discord server). 

Okay, simply...

# Why?

When i was more entertained to dig further in Ongezellig and was craving for more content, i got in problem that Ongezellig simply dont have any archive of official works. So if you wanted to dig further you would need to go on bunch of sites and find those googel discs, and lets be honest - this is not sort of satisfying quest. And probably im not the only one who got into this problem, it probably even harder for new people in Ongezellig community who need to repeat that quest.

## Known Issues

- Ugly .webp format of Maya's Sweet 16 english comic version, please do a pull request if you have png/jpg format.
- No scenario of Ongezellig in Bonusmap, that .docx files are too big and im not even sure i can load them here.
- Probably i forgot many more things for Ongezellig archive, you can always help me with Pull Requests
