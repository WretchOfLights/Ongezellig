friday december 21st

christmas holidays are the worst holidays. when you finally have some free time, you are forced to celebrate a stupid party with a stupid family and stupid christmas music. new year's is even worse, drunken idiots who start making loud noises because the year changes digits. so instead of forgetting that you have to go to school, you have to spend half of the holiday stressing about even more nonsensical obligations.

pippi got in trouble for attacking santa claus at the mall. she called him an imperialist spy and shot him in the head while shouting "saint nicholas is great". it was with a nerf gun so he wasn't hurt of course but the child on his lap was crying very loudly.

coco was quite distant this week.

furthermore, i found at last a personality test that suits me. the results are quite depressing so it must be reliable. i saved it so that i can later compare whether i've made any progress or not.
